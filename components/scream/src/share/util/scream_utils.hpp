// This routine tries to find an arrangment of elements that allow each
// of the input groups to be a contiguous subarray of the global arrangement.
// E.g., given the groups of elments
//    G1=(A,B,C), G2=(A,B,C,D,E), G3=(C,D), G4=(C,D,E,F), G5=((D,E,F,G).
// the ordering of elements (A,B,C,D,E,F,G) clearly has all G's as contiguous
// subset, though it might not be obvious if one scrambled the entris within
// each input group.
// If such an ordering cannot be found, we return an empty list.

// The algorithm is the following.
//  - We proceed iteratively, trying to add one group at a time to the result.
//  - Internally, we store the result as a list of lists (LoL), like
//        [ [A,B], [C], [D,E,F], [G,H], [I], ... ]
//    If the algorithm succeeds, the output of the function is a single list
//    obtainied by splicing together all the inner lists.
//  - We are only allowed to modify the outer list in the following ways:
//      a) rearrange the elements in an inner list: [D,E,F]->[F,D,E]
//      b) split an inner list into multiple lists: [[A,B,C],[D,E]]->[[A,B],[C],[D,E}]
//      c) append a new list (that does not overlap with existing sublists):
//        [[A,B],[C,D]] -> [[A,B],[C,D],[E,F,G]]
//  - The 1st group is added as a single sublist, that is, given G1,..,G5 above,
//    after the first iteration, the list of lists would be [[A,B,C]].
//  - At the generic k-th step of the algorithm, we try to add group G to the LoL,
//    doing the following:
//     - compute intersection of G with each of the sublists of LoL
//     - check that all non-empty intersections are 'contiguous'. If not, the
//       overall algorithm failed, and we can return.
//     - if there's a part of G that does not intersect with any sublist, then
//       there are two scenarios:
//        i) all intersections are at the beginning or end of LoL: good.
//        ii) intersections are neither at the beginning nor at the end of LoL.
//            In this case, the overall algorithm failed, and we can return.
//     - if G has a non-empty intersection with sublist S, there are two scenarios:
//        i) the intersection is the whole S: nothing to do.
//        ii) the intersection is smaller than S: two sub-scenarios:
//          *) S is the first or last sublist with non-empty intersection:
//             split S into [intersection][rest] or [rest][intersection]
//             (the former if it's the first intersection, the former if it's the last).
//             This would correspond to operation (a+b) on the LoL.
//          *) S is neither the first nor the last. In this case the overall
//             algorithm has failed, and we can return.
//     - if G has a portion that does not intersect with any sublist S, add it
//       as a new sublist at the end. This corresponds to operation (c) from above.

// Regardless of the order in which we process the individual lists, if there is
// an arrangement A of T's that allows to have G1,...,Gn as a contiguous sublist
// of A, the above algorithm is guaranteed to find it.
